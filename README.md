## Code description 


### 1. Dynamical system network model

* Directory: /Dynamical_system_model
* Simulation_dynamical_system_model.m is the simulation code for the model, with input from random initial conditions in FHN_init.mat. After each simulation, On/Off population phases of 121 units in attentional and control condition are generated.
* After running Simulation_dynamical_system_model.m, noise correlations are computed based on default uniform On/Off firing rates (r_{on}=130 Hz, r_{off}=50 Hz).
* To compute noise correlations with On/Off firing rates sampled from data (fitted with a 2-state HMM across 31 recording sessions), we can use NC_with_input_firing_rate.m, with input 1) On/Off population phases generated by Simulation_dynamical_system_model.m, 2) distribution of On/Off firing rates sampled from data (distribution_firing_rate.mat). To obtain sufficient samples of On/Off firing rates, the sampling procedure is repeated 10 times and the average noise correlation is computed.



### 2. Binary-unit network model

* Directory: /Binary_units_model
* Simulation_binary_units_model.m is the simulation code for the model, with input from random initial conditions in SPIN_init.mat. After each simulation, On/Off population phases of 121 units in attentional and control condition are generated.
* After running Simulation_binary_units_model.m, noise correlations are computed based on default uniform On/Off firing rates (r_{on}=125 Hz, r_{off}=25 Hz).
